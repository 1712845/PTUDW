                                If you are not 100% satisfied with your purchase from Zappos you can return your item(s) for a full refund within 365 days of purchase. 
                                (Returns must be unworn, in the state you received them, and in the original packaging.) Some items ship with an attached security tag. 
                                Merchandise returned without the original security tag attached or a damaged tag may not qualify for a refund.

                                Make sure the merchandise is in its original packaging, (e.g., shoebox),
                                and place it in a shipping box. Attach the label to the sealed box. Be sure to cover any old labels with the new one,
                                or just peel them off. A black marker can also be used to cover any existing bar codes.

                                You may be able to process an exchange yourself for certain eligible orders in your Zappos.com account.
                                If an order is eligible, you will see an option in your account to select an item to exchange,
                                and will be provided the instructions and terms that apply to your exchange.

                                the funds from the original order will be transferred to an e-Gift Card
                                and applied to the replacement order when the exchange is processed. If the replacement order is returned, 
                                we will issue the refund back to an e-Gift Card for the full amount (minus any shipping charges from the original order). 
                                An exchange also requires the original order to be returned to Zappos within 14 days. If we do not receive the original order 
                                within 14 days, the credit card on file will be charged the full amount of that order.

                                If you process the return by yourself through our website, unfortunately UPS is the only option for most customers. 
                                We provide shipping labels using UPS for easy, fast and secure shipping and package tracking. 
                                However, we understand that UPS isn't always convenient for everyone and we want to make 
                                returning to Zappos as easy as possible.
                                If you would rather receive a USPS return label instead of a UPS return label,

                                current styles, prices, sizes, and overall selection, we do not publish a catalog that you may purchase 
                                directly from us. Plus, with all the styles that we carry, a catalog would be as big as a phone book!

                                Until you have completed the checkout process, another customer may purchase the item even if it is in your cart.
                                If that happens, you will receive a message on the shopping cart page informing you that the item 
                                is no longer available and that you should remove it from your cart.

                                Unfortunately, Zappos.com does not know if an item will go on sale or be marked down until it actually happens. 
                                It is possible for different colors within the same style to have different prices. 
                                For instance, if a blue bag is selling better than a yellow one, one might discount the yellow bag to boost sales.

                                <strong>Acetate:</strong> While most items made of acetate are dry-clean only, 
                                some may be hand-washed in lukewarm water. Do not twist the fabric. 
                                Iron while the fabric is damp. Press the inside of the garment using a low-temperature setting. 
                                Use a pressing cloth when ironing the outside.
                            </p>

                                <strong>Acrylic knit:</strong> Most acrylic knit garments can be machine-washed. Read the label, 
                                and check for the proper drying option. Some knits retain their shapes best if reshaped and dried flat.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Cashmere:</strong> Check the care label before laundering cashmere. To hand-wash, 
                                use a mild detergent or shampoo. 
                                Gently squeeze the water through the garment, then rinse until the water runs clear. Do not wring or twist. 
                                Squeeze out excess water. To dry, lay flat on a towel, away from sunlight or heat.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Cotton:</strong> Cotton holds up well to home laundering. 
                                Remove the garment from the dryer promptly to reduce wrinkling. 
                                Press using spray starch for the crispness of a laundered shirt.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Cotton blend: </strong>  Dry cotton-blend garments using your dryer's permanent-press or low-heat cycle, 
                                and remove immediately to reduce wrinkling. 
                                Touch up with a steam iron; starch for a professionally laundered look.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Linen:</strong> Most linen garments need to be dry-cleaned or hand-washed. 
                                Follow the instructions on the care label. 
                                To touch up or press, use a steam iron on a linen setting for a crisp look.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Nylon:</strong> Machine-wash nylon garments in warm water. Use a low-temperature setting when tumble-drying, 
                                and include a dryer sheet to reduce static electricity. Use a warm iron to press, if necessary.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Polyester:</strong> Read the label. Usually polyester items can be machine-washed (cool) and dried (low). 
                                Check the label to see if air-drying is recommended. Touch up with a cool – never hot – iron, if necessary.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Rayon:</strong>  Make sure to read the care label for rayon clothing. 
                                Launder in cool water and a mild detergent.
                                When machine-washing, use the gentle cycle and promptly remove garments after washing. 
                                When hand-washing, do not wring or twist the garment. To dry, roll the item in a towel to squeeze out excess water. 
                                Lay flat to dry. Iron when still damp and with the garment inside out to prevent the fabric from becoming shiny. 
                                Use a pressing cloth when ironing the right side of the garment. 
                                Pressing cloths can be purchased, or use something as simple as a piece of white cotton fabric.

                                <strong>Silk:</strong> Dry cleaning may be required. Some silks are hand- or machine-washable. 
                                Do not dry silk in a clothes dryer. Garments usually look best when professionally dry-cleaned.

                                <strong>Spandex:</strong> Use warm water when hand- or machine-washing items made with spandex. 
                                Line-dry or use a low temperature setting when machine-drying to preserve the elasticity of the garment.

                                <strong>Wool knit:</strong> Typically wool knits need to be dry-cleaned, but check the label. If hand-washable, 
                                use cool water and a detergent for fine washables. Squeeze out excess water, then reshape and dry flat.

                                <strong>Wool (lined):</strong> Lined garments generally look best when professionally dry-cleaned once a season. 
                                Between dry cleanings, remove surface soil with a brush or damp cloth. 
                                Refresh the item by hanging it from a padded hanger in a steamy bathroom; moisture will help garment shed wrinkles. 
                                When touching up with an iron, use steam in an up-and-down motion (rather than sliding the iron along the fabric).

                                a separate Zappos Gift Certificate for each. If you need any help with purchasing the Zappos Gift

                                please give our Customer Loyalty Team a call, and we will be happy to help! Please also note that 
                                in order to use the pre-paid gift 
                                card on Zappos, it will need to be registered or activated by following the instructions on the 
                                pre-paid gift card itself or on the card’s 
                                packaging. 
                                Also, some card may not be eligible for online purchases. Please refer to the company that 
                                issued the card for more details.

                                then growth in sales will eventually come on their own. So rather than focusing on maximizing profits, 
                                we focus on maximizing the service that we provide. We are committed to your complete satisfaction; 
                                it is our top priority. In addition to offering a wide variety of merchandise, 
                                we strive to provide you with the best service in the industry. Learn more from the links below:
